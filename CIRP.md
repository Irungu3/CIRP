Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan
1. Introduction

A Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan (CIRP) is a structured framework designed to detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents effectively. This document serves as a guide for organizations to handle cybersecurity threats systematically, minimize impact, and ensure a swift return to normal operations.
2. Objectives

    Identify and respond to cybersecurity incidents quickly.

    Minimize operational disruption, financial loss, and data breaches.

    Ensure legal and regulatory compliance.

    Document and analyze incidents for continuous improvement.

3. Incident Response Team (IRT)
3.1 Roles & Responsibilities

    Incident Manager: Leads the response, ensures coordination, and makes critical decisions.

    Forensics Analyst: Investigates, collects evidence, and determines the root cause.

    IT Support: Restores systems and applies necessary patches.

    Communications Lead: Handles internal and external communications.

    Legal & Compliance: Ensures legal and regulatory requirements are met.

4. Incident Classification

Incidents are categorized based on severity and impact:

    Low: Policy violations, unauthorized software installation.

    Medium: Phishing attempts, minor malware infections.

    High: Active breaches, ransomware, data exfiltration.

    Critical: System-wide compromise, widespread denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

5. Incident Response Lifecycle
5.1 Preparation

    Develop security policies and response procedures.

    Implement monitoring tools (SIEM, IDS/IPS).

    Conduct regular cybersecurity training and tabletop exercises.

5.2 Detection & Analysis

    Monitor logs and alerts from security tools.

    Use forensic tools to analyze suspicious activity.

    Categorize incidents based on scope and impact.

5.3 Containment

    Short-term: Isolate affected systems to prevent further spread.

    Long-term: Patch vulnerabilities and enhance security controls.

5.4 Eradication

    Remove malicious code, malware, and backdoors.

    Conduct system-wide vulnerability assessments.

5.5 Recovery

    Restore data from backups.

    Monitor for signs of reinfection.

    Verify integrity of systems before resuming operations.

5.6 Lessons Learned

    Conduct a post-incident review.

    Document findings, timeline, and response actions.

    Update policies and improve response strategies.

6. Communication & Reporting

    Internal: Notify stakeholders and executive management.

    External: Communicate with regulatory bodies, law enforcement, and affected customers.

    Documentation: Maintain incident logs, response reports, and forensic evidence.

7. Tools & Technologies

    SIEM Solutions: Splunk, Wazuh

    Forensic Tools: Autopsy, Volatility

    Network Security: Snort, Wireshark

    Malware Analysis: Cuckoo Sandbox

8. Testing & Training

    Conduct incident response drills and red team exercises.

    Implement phishing awareness programs.

    Regularly update team members on emerging threats.

9. Compliance & Legal Considerations

    Align with industry standards (ISO 27001, NIST 800-61, GDPR, HIPAA).

    Maintain regulatory compliance and audit readiness.

    Preserve legal evidence for law enforcement if necessary.

10. Incident Response Templates

To streamline response efforts, the following templates are included:

    Incident Report Template (reports/incident_report_template.md)

    Forensic Analysis Checklist (tools/forensic_tools_list.txt)

    Communication Templates for internal and external reporting.
